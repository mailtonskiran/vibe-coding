# Mutual Fund Recommendation System: Logic and Responsible AI

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a transparent and comprehensive explanation of the logic behind the mutual fund recommendation system. Our goal is to empower users by making our recommendation process clear, understandable, and trustworthy. This aligns with our commitment to Responsible AI, ensuring that our automated guidance is explainable and ethical.

## 2. Data Collection

The system bases its recommendations on the information provided by the user through the investor profile form. This includes:
- **Demographic Information:** Age, education, occupation.
- **Financial Information:** Income, expenses, assets, liabilities, and total investment amount.
- **Risk Assessment:** Responses to a 12-question risk tolerance questionnaire.
- **Behavioral Profile:** Responses to a 7-question behavioral finance questionnaire.

## 3. Scoring and Profiling Logic

The system calculates several scores to create a detailed investor profile. This process is entirely rules-based.

### 3.1. Risk Score (Max: 480 points)
- Each of the 12 risk assessment questions has four options (A, B, C, D).
- These are mapped to a numerical score: `A=1`, `B=2`, `C=3`, `D=4`.
- The scores from all 12 questions are summed and multiplied by 10, resulting in a final score between 120 and 480.

### 3.2. Profile Score (Max: 28 points)
- Each of the 7 additional profile questions is scored similarly (`A=1` to `D=4`).
- The scores are summed to produce a behavioral profile score between 7 and 28.

### 3.3. Risk Tolerance Level
- The calculated **Risk Score** is used to assign one of four risk tolerance levels:
  - **Conservative:** Score <= 200
  - **Cautious:** Score <= 300
  - **Moderate:** Score <= 400
  - **Aggressive:** Score > 400

## 4. Asset Allocation Strategy

The investor's **Risk Tolerance Level** is the primary driver for the strategic asset allocation. The system uses a predefined matrix to recommend the percentage of the total investment to be allocated to each of the five core asset classes.

| Risk Tolerance Level   | Equity | Hybrid/BAF | Debt/Arbitrage | International Equity | Gold |
|------------------------|--------|------------|----------------|----------------------|------|
| **Conservative**       | 10%    | 20%        | 60%            | 5%                   | 5%   |
| **Cautious**           | 25%    | 35%        | 30%            | 5%                   | 5%   |
| **Moderate**           | 50%    | 25%        | 15%            | 5%                   | 5%   |
| **Aggressive**         | 70%    | 15%        | 5%             | 7%                   | 3%   |

The system then calculates the exact monetary amount for each asset class based on the user's specified `Total Investment Amount`.

## 5. Fund Selection Logic

After determining the amount to be invested in each asset class, the system selects a single, specific fund for that class using the following hierarchical logic:

1.  **Filter by Asset Class:** It first gathers all available funds from our database that match the target asset class (e.g., it collects all 'Equity' funds).
2.  **Check Affordability:** It filters this list down to funds where the `minimum investment` amount is less than or equal to the calculated allocation amount for that asset class.
3.  **Select Best Performer:** From the list of affordable funds, it selects the single fund with the **highest `expected_return`**.
4.  **Fallback Logic:** If no funds are affordable with the allocated amount (i.e., the allocation is less than the minimum investment for all available funds), the system recommends the fund with the **lowest `minimum investment`** to ensure a viable starting point is always provided.

This ensures that the final list of recommended funds perfectly adds up to the total investment amount.

## 6. Financial Health Assessment

The system performs a basic financial health check based on user-provided data and may issue simple warnings:
- **High Debt-to-Income Ratio:** If liabilities are more than 40% of monthly income.
- **Insufficient Emergency Fund:** If the emergency fund is less than 6 months of monthly expenses.
- **Negative Monthly Surplus:** If monthly expenses exceed monthly income.

## 7. Limitations & Disclaimer

- **Simplified Model:** This system is a demonstration and uses a simplified, static database of funds and expected returns.
- **No Guarantees:** `expected_return` values are hypothetical and not a guarantee of future performance.
- **Not Professional Advice:** The recommendations generated by this tool do not constitute professional financial advice. All financial decisions involve risk. Users should consult with a qualified and licensed financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
